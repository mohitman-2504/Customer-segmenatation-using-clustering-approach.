# Customer-segmenatation-using-clustering-approach.
Unsupervised clustering of a grocery's firm's customer's database to form customer segmentation.

In this project, I will be performing an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a groceries firm's database. Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster. I will divide customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. To modify products according to distinct needs and behaviours of the customers. It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers.


Problem Statement:- Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers. Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.


Target
Need to perform clustering to summarize customer segments.
